# iOS Offline Receive — switch Breez push to FCM (the official path)

## Why
Breez's reference NDS (`breez/notify`, what `sonar-breez-nds` runs) is **FCM-only** (confirmed in
Breez docs + source). The official flow for **both** platforms is:

```
app (Firebase FCM token) → registerWebhook(.../api/v1/notify?platform=ios&token=<FCM>)
  → Breez swap server POSTs the webhook when the wallet is offline
  → breez/notify sends an FCM message
  → Firebase delivers to iOS via APNs (using the .p8 uploaded to the Firebase Console)
  → iOS launches the Notification Service Extension → answers the invoice_request
```

Sonar **Android** and **Unify (iOS)** both do exactly this. Sonar **iOS** is the only outlier:
it has no Firebase and registers a **raw APNs token**, which `breez/notify` (FCM) cannot deliver.
Result: the offline-wake push never reaches the device, the NSE never fires, the payer's
`bolt12/fetch` times out.

**The server (`breez-nds`) is correct as-is.** The fix is entirely client-side: make Sonar iOS
use Firebase/FCM for the Breez webhook, like Unify. The NSE + App Group we already built stay.

## Reference (proven working)
- Unify iOS: `ios/Wallet/UnifyWalletApp.swift` (FirebaseApp.configure, `Messaging.apnsToken`,
  `didReceiveRegistrationToken` → register FCM token), `ios/project.yml` (FirebaseMessaging pkg).
- Sonar Android: `apps/sonar/.../push/SonarPushRegistration.kt` (`FirebaseMessaging.getInstance().token`).

---

## Part A — Firebase Console (prerequisite; needs project owner)
The Sonar Firebase project already exists (Android uses it; `deploy/secrets/firebase.json` is its
service account). Add iOS to it:

1. Firebase Console → the **Sonar** project → **Add app → iOS**.
2. iOS bundle ID: **`sh.hedwig.sonar`**. Register it.
3. Download the generated **`GoogleService-Info.plist`** → hand it to me (it goes in `ios/bitchat/`,
   gitignored like the other secrets).
4. Project Settings → **Cloud Messaging** → under the iOS app → **APNs Authentication Key**:
   upload **`deploy/secrets/apns.p8`**, Key ID **`PX84KR34WH`**, Team ID **`ZQB239SHCM`**.

Without step 3 the app can't initialize Firebase; without step 4 FCM can't reach iOS.

---

## Part B — iOS code (I implement; 1:1 with Unify)
1. **Add the Firebase SPM package** to `ios/bitchat.xcodeproj`: `firebase-ios-sdk` (majorVersion 11),
   link product **`FirebaseMessaging`** to the `bitchat_iOS` target. (Same gem-script approach used
   to add BreezSDKLiquid; `FirebaseMessaging` pulls `FirebaseCore`.)
2. **Add `GoogleService-Info.plist`** to the `bitchat_iOS` target (from Part A.3), and add it to
   `.gitignore`.
3. **AppDelegate** (`ios/bitchat/BitchatApp.swift:242`):
   - `import FirebaseCore`, `import FirebaseMessaging`; conform to `MessagingDelegate`.
   - On launch: `FirebaseApp.configure()` + `Messaging.messaging().delegate = self`.
   - In `didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken` (line 251): add
     `Messaging.messaging().apnsToken = deviceToken` **and keep** the existing
     `SonarPushRegistration.shared.didRegisterForRemoteNotifications(...)` (Transponder still uses
     the raw APNs token).
   - Add `messaging(_:didReceiveRegistrationToken:)` → forward the **FCM token** to
     `SonarPushRegistration`.
4. **`SonarPushRegistration.swift`**:
   - Split the two channels: **Transponder** keeps the **APNs** token (unchanged);
     **Breez NDS** uses the **FCM** token.
   - Change `registerBreezWebhook` to take the FCM token string and build
     `\(ndsUrl)/api/v1/notify?platform=ios&token=<FCM_TOKEN>`; trigger it from the new FCM-token
     callback (and on wallet-ready, like today via `retryBreezWebhookIfNeeded`).
5. **Disable Firebase method swizzling** to avoid it hijacking the Transponder's APNs push handling:
   set `FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled = NO` in `ios/bitchat/Info.plist`, and keep forwarding
   pushes through the existing `didReceiveRemoteNotification` → `SonarPushProcessor` routing
   (already branches breez vs marmot).
6. **NSE: no change** — `SonarNotificationService` already connects Breez from the App Group and
   answers the invoice_request; the FCM→APNs push is what triggers it.

## Part C — build, deploy, verify
1. Build `bitchat (iOS)` (resolves Firebase), install on the iPhone.
2. Confirm at launch: Firebase configures, an **FCM token** is obtained, and
   `Breez NDS webhook registered` now uses `token=<FCM token>` (not the APNs hex).
3. **Offline test:** force-quit the iPhone app → pay it from macOS → expect on the iPhone:
   `apsd` push for `sh.hedwig.sonar` → `NSE: didReceive` → `getConnectRequest -> creds OK` →
   Breez answers the invoice → macOS `bolt12/fetch` returns an invoice (no `TimedOut`).
4. Cross-check `sonar-breez-nds` logs on the `65` box: a real `POST /api/v1/notify` arrives and a
   push is sent (no more 400 / no more idle).

## Gotchas / risks
- **FCM token vs APNs token**: the Breez webhook MUST get the FCM token; the Transponder MUST keep
  the APNs token. Don't cross them.
- **Swizzling**: Firebase swizzles the app delegate by default; disabling it (step B.5) keeps the
  Transponder path intact — verify chat pushes still work after the change.
- **mutable-content**: the NSE only fires for `mutable-content` pushes. `breez/notify`'s FCM message
  for iOS must set the APNs `mutable-content` flag — Unify proves it does; verify in the test.
- **Build size**: Firebase is a large dependency; acceptable, Android already ships it.
- **`breez-nds` health check** is cosmetically failing (HEAD probe → 404); not functional, but worth
  fixing the healthcheck to a POST or `/` 200 separately.

## Already done (no change needed)
- NSE target + App Group + Breez working-dir move (shipped).
- `breez-nds` (FCM) on the `65` box — correct; just needs real traffic once iOS sends FCM tokens.

## ROOT CAUSE of "swap server never POSTs the webhook" (found 2026-06-24)
Even after the FCM client fix landed and the iOS app registered the Breez webhook with the FCM
token, **`breez-nds` received zero `POST /api/v1/notify`** — the Boltz/Breez swap server never
called the webhook. Verified on the box: only health-check GETs; `firebase.json` is the right
project (`sonarchat-11566`); `NOTIFY_EXTERNAL_URL=https://nds.sonar.hedwig.sh`.

**Why (sourced from breez-sdk-liquid):** the webhook is bound to **each BOLT12 offer**, captured at
**offer-creation time** on the Boltz server (`sdk.rs create_bolt12_offer` snapshots
`get_webhook_url()` and POSTs the offer to Boltz `POST /v2/lightning/BTC/bolt12` with `url=`).
Boltz then delivers an `invoice.request` to the offer owner over **one of two transports**:
WebSocket (online) **or** the per-offer webhook (offline). `registerWebhook()` alone is NOT enough —
it only re-PATCHes offers already in the SDK's **local `bolt12_offers` DB** whose stored URL differs
(`sdk.rs register_webhook`). Boltz requires **HTTPS** webhook URLs (ours is).

So for Sonar the offer the payer hits has **`url=None` (or stale)** on Boltz → Boltz only tries the
dead WS path when the wallet is offline → no POST → `bolt12/fetch` times out. Confirmed by the iPhone
SDK logs showing the offer being *prepared/subscribed* but **no `update_bolt12_offer` / PATCH** to
write our webhook onto it. (SDK version 0.12.4 has the feature — BOLT12-receive commit #882 predates
it — so this is not a version gap; `createBolt12Offer` is internal, reached via
`receivePayment(.bolt12Offer)`.)

## Implementation plan — force webhook re-subscription on the advertised offer (#126)

The earlier `createOffer()`-after-`registerWebhook` attempt was a no-op (`receivePayment(.bolt12Offer)`
reuses the cached offer by description, never re-registers) and was removed in `1683a6a9`. The real fix
is to **force the webhook PATCH onto the offer on every relevant launch**, self-healing, idempotent:

1. **Force re-subscribe (misty-breez pattern):** `unregisterWebhook()` → `registerWebhook(url)`.
   A plain `registerWebhook` no-ops when the local `bolt12_offers.webhook_url` already equals the URL
   but Boltz still holds `url=None` (our desync). The unregister→register cycle clears local state then
   re-PATCHes Boltz, forcing the `update_bolt12_offer` call. (Brief sub-second window where Boltz holds
   no webhook for the offer — acceptable, matches the reference.)

2. **Idempotency marker:** persist `sha256(offer | fcmToken | ndsUrl)` in `UserDefaults`. Re-subscribe
   only when the offer, the FCM token, or the NDS URL changes — not on every launch.

3. **Coordinate offer + token:** the offer comes from `SonarAppStore.publishPaymentMetadataIfNeeded`
   (`wallet.createOffer()`), the FCM token from `AppDelegate.messaging(_:didReceiveRegistrationToken:)`.
   They arrive async; whichever lands second triggers the subscribe. The advertised offer and the
   webhook-registered offer are the **same** `createOffer()` string, so there is no offer mismatch.

### Code
- `SonarPushRegistration.swift`: add `cachedOffer`, a `breez_webhook_marker` key, and
  `ensureBreezWebhook(offer:wallet:)` (guards FCM token + `.ready`; compares marker; on change does
  `unregisterWebhook()` → `registerWebhook(url)` → stores marker). `didReceiveFCMToken` /
  `retryBreezWebhookIfNeeded` call it with the cached offer.
- `SonarAppStore.publishPaymentMetadataIfNeeded`: after publishing, call
  `SonarPushRegistration.shared.ensureBreezWebhook(offer:wallet:)`.
- Bridge already exposes `registerWebhook(url:)` + `unregisterWebhook()` (`WalletBridgeService`).

### Verification
Deploy → pay **backgrounded** from macOS → a `POST /api/v1/notify` on `sonar-breez-nds` = fixed.
Still zero → the offer isn't in the SDK's local `bolt12_offers` table (deeper); add a `#if DEBUG`
log of `listBolt12Offers().count` + the PATCH result and capture on-device SDK logs over USB.

### Cross-platform
Android already registers the Breez webhook with the FCM token (`AppComponent.registerPushWebhookIfReady`).
Check whether it has the same re-subscribe/marker robustness; if not, mirror the unregister→register
there. Tracked under #126.

## Test results — 2026-06-24 (re-subscription fix `3cb8ea54`, osx payer → iPhone)

The unregister→register fix did **not** move the server signal. Measured:

| Receiver state | Result | Path |
|---|---|---|
| backgrounded, WS still alive (~mins) | receives (`PaymentSucceeded`, 1000 sat) | swap WebSocket |
| backgrounded long enough to suspend / **force-quit** | `bolt12/fetch TimedOut` | needs webhook |

`sonar-breez-nds` logged **zero** real `POST /api/v1/notify` for our offer throughout — so the offer
still has `url=None` on Boltz and the webhook fallback never fired. Backgrounded success was the WS, not
the fix. Unify's NDS (`nds.hedwig.sh`) *did* get a real Boltz `200` POST in the same window, confirming
the infra works; the gap remains our offer not carrying the webhook.

**Still blind on the device.** usbmuxd not connected (no `idevicesyslog`); `devicectl --console` is empty
for os_log; and `devicectl device copy from --domain-type appGroupDataContainer --source breez-sdk`
fails with `File paths cannot contain '..'` (CoreDeviceError 11007), so we can't read the SDK's local
`bolt12_offers.webhook_url` either. Resolving this needs a USB+Trust connection to capture the Breez SDK
+ `SonarPush` logs and see which step fails (FCM token issued? `ensureBreezWebhook` ran? unregister→register
executed? `update_bolt12_offer` PATCH emitted to Boltz?). New suspect: `FirebaseAppDelegateProxyEnabled=NO`
may have broken FCM token issuance. Symptom-level tracking in #127; webhook root cause in #126.
