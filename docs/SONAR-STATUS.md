# Sonar status over Nostr

How Sonar publishes and displays system status without a proprietary status host.

1. **`sonar-status`** (Rust binary in `core/sonar-status`) probes relays (and
   optional HTTP health URLs), builds a JSON document, signs a replaceable
   Nostr event, and publishes it.
2. **Website** `/status` paints seed data immediately, then (if
   `STATUS_PUBKEY_HEX` is set) REQs the latest event and merges services /
   incidents / optional relay list.
3. **Browser** still measures live WebSocket RTT to the relay list for the
   “Relay network” section (visitor-local latency).

## Event format

| Field | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `kind` | `30078` |
| tag `d` | `sonar-status` |
| tag `client` | `sonar-status` (optional, set by publisher) |
| `content` | UTF-8 JSON (see below) |
| `pubkey` | Ops status key — must equal site `STATUS_PUBKEY_HEX` |

### Content JSON (website schema)

```json
{
  "services": [
    {
      "id": "dm",
      "name": "Encrypted DMs (Marmot)",
      "desc": "End-to-end encrypted direct messages",
      "uptime": 99.95,
      "state": "degraded"
    }
  ],
  "relays": [
    { "url": "wss://relay.damus.io", "region": "Global · CDN" }
  ],
  "incidents": [
    {
      "date": "Jul 13, 2026",
      "title": "Probe detected degraded performance",
      "level": "degraded",
      "updates": [
        { "t": "15:04 UTC", "s": "Investigating", "b": "…" }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

Rules enforced by `web/src/lib/status-nostr.js`:

- `services[].id` — `^[A-Za-z0-9._-]{1,40}$`
- `state` — omit or `ok` | `degraded` | `down` (omit/`ok` = operational)
- `uptime` — number 0…100
- `incidents[].level` — `degraded` | `maintenance` | `down`
- `updates[].s` — `Investigating` | `Identified` | `Monitoring` | `Resolved` | `Completed`
- `relays[].url` — `wss:` only
- max content size 64 KiB

Operator-only fields (`updated_at`, `probe`) may appear in local `--out` files
but are **stripped** from the published event content by `sonar-status`.

## Constants (keep in sync)

| Location | Symbols |
| --- | --- |
| `core/sonar-status/src/main.rs` | `STATUS_EVENT_KIND`, `STATUS_EVENT_D` |
| `web/src/lib/status-data.js` | `STATUS_EVENT_KIND`, `STATUS_EVENT_D`, `STATUS_PUBKEY_HEX`, `STATUS_NPUB`, `STATUS_FEED_RELAYS` |

## Operator runbook

1. Generate a dedicated status key (not a user chat nsec):

   ```bash
   # example: 32 random bytes as hex (or use any nsec1 wallet export)
   openssl rand -hex 32 > ~/.config/sonar/status.hex
   chmod 600 ~/.config/sonar/status.hex
   cargo run -p sonar-status --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml -- \
     identity --nsec-file ~/.config/sonar/status.hex
   ```

2. Put `pubkey_hex` / `npub` into `web/src/lib/status-data.js` and deploy the site.

3. Cron every 5–15 minutes:

   ```bash
   ./scripts/status/publish.sh
   ```

4. Open `/status/` — hero should switch from `seed data` to `status feed` once
   the event is visible on `STATUS_FEED_RELAYS`.

## Trust model

- Website filters by **author pubkey** + kind + `d`.
- v1 website does **not** verify schnorr (same limitation as the stickers page).
  Publishing still signs correctly; a future web crypto verify is a follow-up.
- Anyone who steals the status nsec can publish false status — protect the file.

## Client bootstrap relays (status "Relay network")

The status page and `sonar-status` probe the **same default relay set Sonar apps
connect to**, not an arbitrary marketing list:

| Relay | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `wss://relay.damus.io` | iOS + Android + CLI |
| `wss://nos.lol` | iOS + Android + CLI |
| `wss://relay.primal.net` | iOS + Android + CLI |
| `wss://offchain.pub` | iOS `NostrRelayManager` |
| `wss://nostr21.com` | iOS `NostrRelayManager` |
| `wss://relay.kaleidoswap.com` | iOS + Android/JVM |
| `wss://nostr.relay.hedwig.sh` | Android/JVM (+ Hedwig) |

### White Noise interop relays

Sonar talks Marmot to the official White Noise clients, so the relays those
clients bootstrap against are monitored **as part of the same `relays` row**:

| Relay | Source |
| --- | --- |
| `wss://relay.us.whitenoise.chat` | `MarmotClient.bootstrapRelays` (whitenoise-android) |
| `wss://relay.eu.whitenoise.chat` | `MarmotClient.bootstrapRelays` (whitenoise-android) |

Keep these in sync with `MarmotClient.kt` in
[marmot-protocol/whitenoise-android](https://github.com/marmot-protocol/whitenoise-android);
override at runtime with `--whitenoise-relays` / `SONAR_STATUS_WHITENOISE_RELAYS`.

Sonar's own traffic does not use these relays, but they are deliberately treated
like relays we do use: they count toward the reachable ratio and median RTT, so a
White Noise outage degrades the relay row and opens an incident. Marmot interop
with the official clients is broken at that point, and that is worth saying out
loud on the status page.

One property is deliberate and should survive refactors: **they are
reachability-probed only.** `--chat-probe` / `--sticker-probe` *publish* events,
and those writes stay on `DEFAULT_RELAYS` — `WHITENOISE_RELAYS` is never written
to. We monitor third-party infrastructure; we do not write to it to fill in a
status page. `build_payload` keeps the two lists separate for exactly this
reason: the monitored set is the union, the write set is `DEFAULT_RELAYS` alone.

**Out of scope for both tables:** geohash / location-channel relays from
`relays/online_relays_gps.csv` / `GeoRelayDirectory` — those are chosen
per-geohash at runtime and change with the user.

Keep these three places in sync when the app defaults change:

1. `ios/bitchat/Nostr/NostrRelayManager.swift` `defaultRelays`
2. `apps/sonar/.../SonarCore.android.kt` / `SonarCore.jvm.kt`
3. `web/src/lib/status-data.js` + `core/sonar-status` `DEFAULT_RELAYS`

The interop set has one upstream instead: `MarmotClient.bootstrapRelays` in
whitenoise-android → `core/sonar-status` `WHITENOISE_RELAYS`.

## Seed vs live services

| Source | Services | Incidents | When |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Website seed | Skeleton rows, all operational, **no mock outages** | **Empty** | First paint / feed unavailable |
| `sonar-status` probe | Only **measured** rows (`relays` + optional HTTP) | Auto from measured failures | Each publish |
| Future dedicated probes | Per-surface rows (DM, push, …) with real checks | Same | As probes land |

The website may still list the full product surface (DM, groups, …) as a
**skeleton** so the page layout matches the design. Those rows stay operational
until the feed supplies a measured `state` for the same `id`.

### Merge rule (website)

When a status event arrives:

1. Replace `incidents` entirely from the feed (seed has none).
2. For `services`: **upsert by `id`** — feed rows override seed rows with the
   same id; seed-only ids remain as operational placeholders until probed.
3. For `relays`: if the feed includes a non-empty list, use it (and re-ping);
   otherwise keep the client-default seed list.

Website merge is **upsert-by-id** via `mergeStatusPayload` in
`web/src/lib/status-data.js`.

## Real service probes (design)

Goal: every row on `/status` should eventually mean "we ran a check", not
"design mock uptime".

### Probe matrix

| Service id | Check (v1 target) | How `sonar-status` implements it | Auth / secrets |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `relays` | WebSocket open RTT to client default + White Noise interop relays | **Done** — `probe_relay_ws` | None |
| `dm` | KeyPackage publish + fetch own package from bootstrap relays via `sonar-core` | **Done** — `chat::probe_marmot_keypackage` (`--chat-probe`) | **Dedicated probe nsec** (`SONAR_STATUS_PROBE_NSEC`) — not the publisher key |
| `groups` | 5-agent MLS group via Hermes task (A→B or multi-member) | **Done** (Hermes `groups-probe.sh`) | Probe nsec(s) |
| `media` | Blossom reachability: HTTP HEAD `DEFAULT_BLOSSOM_SERVER` | **Done** | None |
| `stickers` | REQ kind 30031 on bootstrap relays, count visible packs | **Done** | None |
| `push` | HTTP GET transponder health (and optionally sandbox) | `--http` / `SONAR_STATUS_HTTP` | None if health is public |
| `payments` | HTTP GET Breez NDS / notify health if exposed; else mark `unknown` and omit row | `--http` | None |
| `calls` | Optional: connect Iroh relay / echo; else inherit signaling from `relays` + separate note | deferred | None |

### States

| State | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| omit / `ok` | Check passed |
| `degraded` | Check passed slowly or partially (e.g. &lt;85% relays, high RTT, HTTP 429) |
| `down` | Check failed (timeout, HTTP 5xx, zero relays) |
| *absent from feed* | Not measured this run — website keeps skeleton operational |

Do **not** invent degraded product rows from relay latency alone. Relay trouble
is reported on `id: "relays"`; product rows appear only when their probe runs.

### Publishing cadence

- Cron every **5–15 minutes** (`scripts/status/publish.sh`).
- Keep `--previous` / state dir so incidents open/resolve instead of spamming.
- Publish relays must include at least one of `STATUS_FEED_RELAYS` on the site
  (include `wss://nostr.relay.hedwig.sh` when using Hedwig infra).

### Rollout steps

1. **Done:** client-default relays; empty seed incidents; measured `relays` (+ HTTP).
2. **Done:** website upsert-by-id merge (`mergeStatusPayload`).
3. **Done:** Marmot KeyPackage round-trip → service `dm` via `--chat-probe` +
   dedicated probe nsec (`core/sonar-status/src/chat.rs`).
4. **Next:** A→B text canary (two probe identities) for stronger E2E `dm` / `groups`.
5. **Next:** `probe_sticker_index` + Blossom HEAD (no chat identity).
6. **Optional:** store daily uptime samples to drive real 90-day bars (replace
   `syntheticHistory`).

### Local verify

```bash
# Probe only — should list relays (+ any --http), not mock DM outages
cargo run -p sonar-status --manifest-path core/Cargo.toml -- probe --pretty

# Dry-run publish
SONAR_STATUS_NSEC=… ./scripts/status/publish.sh --dry-run
```
