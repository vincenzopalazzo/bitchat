# Sonar Sticker Packs

Status: draft. This document specifies the Sonar sticker-pack metadata format
implemented by `core/sonar-stickers`, `sonar-cli post`, and the `/stickers` web
viewer.

## Goals

- Publish sticker packs as Nostr addressable events.
- Store sticker image bytes outside relays on HTTPS Blossom-compatible servers.
- Let clients render a sticker pack without knowing Signal-specific secrets.
- Keep sent sticker references stable even if an addressable pack is edited.
- Preserve a path for Signal sticker-pack import without publishing Signal
  `pack_key` material.

## Identifiers

- Pack format marker: `sonar-sticker-pack-v1`
- Sticker pack event kind: `30031`
- User installed-pack list kind: `10031`
- Pack address coordinate: `30031:<author-pubkey-hex>:<identifier>`

Kinds `30031` (addressable pack) and `10031` (replaceable installed list)
deliberately sit one slot above the NIP-51/NIP-30 custom-emoji kinds `30030`
(emoji set) and `10030` (user emoji list). Stickers reuse the emoji event shape
(`title`/`image`/`description`/`emoji` tags on the pack, `a`-tag pointers on the
list) but must not collide with emoji kinds, or every Nostr client would parse
Sonar packs as emoji sets and a user's installed-pack list as their emoji list.
These kinds are not yet in the Nostr registry-of-kinds; reserving them upstream
is tracked as a follow-up.

The `<author-pubkey-hex>` field is the 64-character lowercase Nostr public key
that signed the pack event. The `<identifier>` field is the event `d` tag value
and must be 1 to 80 ASCII characters containing only alphanumeric characters,
dot, underscore, or dash.

Signal imports use:

```text
signal-<signal-pack-id>
```

as the pack identifier, where `<signal-pack-id>` is Signal's 32-character hex
pack id.

## Sticker Assets

Sticker image bytes are uploaded to Blossom-compatible HTTPS storage before the
pack event is published. A valid sticker asset has:

- `url`: an `https://` URL whose path contains the lowercase SHA-256 hash.
- `sha256`: 64 hex characters for the plaintext sticker image bytes.
- `mime`: one of `image/webp`, `image/png`, `image/apng`, or `image/gif`.
- `dim`: optional `WIDTHxHEIGHT`, with both values between `1` and `4096`.

Clients must not render non-HTTPS sticker URLs. Clients should verify that the
URL contains the advertised SHA-256 and may additionally download and hash the
blob before caching it.

## Pack Event

A sticker pack is a Nostr addressable event:

```json
{
  "kind": 30031,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["d", "<identifier>"],
    ["title", "<pack title>"],
    ["pack_format", "sonar-sticker-pack-v1"],
    ["t", "sonar-sticker-pack-v1"],
    ["description", "<optional description>"],
    ["image", "<cover-url>", "<cover-sha256>", "<optional WIDTHxHEIGHT>"],
    ["license", "<optional license>"],
    ["sticker", "<shortcode>", "<url>", "<sha256>", "<mime>", "<optional WIDTHxHEIGHT>", "<optional alt>", "<optional emoji>"],
    ["emoji", "<shortcode>", "<url>"]
  ]
}
```

Required tags:

- `d`
- `title`
- `pack_format` with value `sonar-sticker-pack-v1`
- at least one `sticker`

Recommended discovery tag:

- `t` with value `sonar-sticker-pack-v1`

Optional tags:

- `description`
- `image`
- `license`
- `emoji`

The `pack_format` tag is the normative client marker. The `t` hashtag is present
for relay-indexable discovery and broad Nostr tooling compatibility.

## Sticker Tag

Sticker tags use this positional schema:

```json
["sticker", "<shortcode>", "<url>", "<sha256>", "<mime>", "<dim>", "<alt>", "<emoji>"]
```

Fields:

- `shortcode`: 1 to 64 ASCII alphanumeric or underscore characters. It is unique
  within the pack.
- `url`: HTTPS Blossom-compatible URL containing `sha256`.
- `sha256`: plaintext sticker image hash.
- `mime`: allowlisted image MIME type.
- `dim`: optional `WIDTHxHEIGHT`; use an empty string when omitted but later
  fields are present.
- `alt`: optional accessibility text, at most 160 characters.
- `emoji`: optional representative emoji string, at most 8 characters.

Pack validation rejects duplicate shortcodes and duplicate sticker hashes.

## Cover Image Tag

The optional cover image tag uses:

```json
["image", "<url>", "<sha256>", "<optional WIDTHxHEIGHT>"]
```

The cover follows the same URL, hash, and dimension validation as stickers. The
current parser treats cover MIME as `image/webp`; publishers should use a WebP
cover or omit the cover and let clients use the first sticker.

## Emoji Compatibility Tag

For compatibility with Nostr clients that understand simple emoji image tags,
publishers also emit:

```json
["emoji", "<shortcode>", "<url>"]
```

Sonar clients must prefer `sticker` tags over `emoji` tags because `sticker`
tags carry the immutable hash and MIME metadata required for safe rendering.

## Installed Pack List

A user can publish the sticker packs installed in their client as kind `10031`.
The event content is empty. Each installed pack is represented by an `a` tag:

```json
{
  "kind": 10031,
  "content": "",
  "tags": [
    ["a", "30031:<author-pubkey-hex>:<identifier>"]
  ]
}
```

Clients should deduplicate repeated pack addresses while preserving the first
seen order.

## Sent Sticker Reference

When a chat message references a sticker, the reference tag must include the
immutable plaintext sticker hash:

```json
["sticker", "30031:<author-pubkey-hex>:<identifier>", "<shortcode>", "<plaintext-sha256>"]
```

The hash prevents an edited addressable pack from silently changing the meaning
of an old chat message. A client resolving a sent sticker must verify that the
current pack still contains a sticker with both the referenced shortcode and the
referenced plaintext hash. If it does not, the client should render a missing or
untrusted sticker state instead of substituting a different image.

Local-first clients may render verified cached image bytes without relay access
only when their latest locally validated pack metadata still authorizes the
exact pack coordinate, shortcode, and plaintext hash. Pack metadata and image
bytes must be invalidated together when local chat identity data is erased.

## Publishing Flow

`sonar-cli post <signal-link>` implements the current publishing flow:

1. Load the local CLI Nostr identity from `--home` or `SONAR_CLI_HOME`.
2. Parse the Signal link and decrypt the Signal manifest with the Signal
   `pack_key`.
3. Download and decrypt each Signal sticker asset.
4. Compute the plaintext SHA-256 of each sticker.
5. Upload each plaintext sticker to the configured Blossom server.
6. Build a Sonar `StickerPack` with address
   `30031:<publisher-pubkey>:signal-<signal-pack-id>`.
7. Publish the signed kind `30031` pack event to the configured relays.
8. Print JSON containing the pack address, event id, relays, Blossom server,
   website URL, sticker count, and skipped Signal ids if any.

The Signal `pack_key` is only used locally for decryption and must never be
included in a Nostr event, Blossom upload, website URL, log, or shareable pack
address.

## Signal Import

Signal sticker links have the form:

```text
https://signal.art/addstickers/#pack_id=<32-hex>&pack_key=<hex-or-base64>
```

The importer supports `pack_key` encoded as 32-byte hex, standard base64,
URL-safe base64, or unpadded URL-safe base64. Internally it normalizes the key to
hex.

Signal encrypted blobs use:

```text
iv || ciphertext || mac
```

where:

- `iv` is 16 bytes.
- `ciphertext` is AES-256-CBC with PKCS#7 padding.
- `mac` is HMAC-SHA256 over `iv || ciphertext`.
- AES and HMAC keys are derived with HKDF-SHA256 from the 32-byte Signal pack
  key, a 32-byte zero salt, and info string `Sticker Pack`.
- HKDF output is 64 bytes: first 32 bytes AES key, next 32 bytes HMAC key.

The manifest protobuf is:

```proto
message StickerPack {
  message Sticker {
    optional uint32 id    = 1;
    optional string emoji = 2;
  }

  optional string  title    = 1;
  optional string  author   = 2;
  optional Sticker cover    = 3;
  repeated Sticker stickers = 4;
}
```

Importer limits:

- manifest response: 512 KiB
- sticker response: 4 MiB
- stickers per pack: 200

If a local network intercepts TLS with a private CA, the CLI can use
`--accept-invalid-signal-certs`. This flag only affects encrypted Signal CDN
fetches; decrypted bytes are still authenticated by Signal's HMAC before they
are accepted.

If a Signal manifest references an unavailable asset, the CLI can use
`--skip-missing-signal-stickers`. Skipped Signal sticker ids are included in the
JSON output. Without this flag, any failed Signal sticker fetch aborts the
import.

## Web Resolution

The `/stickers` web route accepts:

```text
/stickers?a=30031:<author-pubkey-hex>:<identifier>&relay=wss://relay.example
```

When `a` is present, the route queries the provided relays with a kind `30031`
filter scoped to the author and `d` tag. Without `a`, it queries recent kind
`30031` events tagged with `t=sonar-sticker-pack-v1`.

The web viewer treats relay events as untrusted input. It renders only parsed
pack events that:

- are kind `30031`;
- include `pack_format=sonar-sticker-pack-v1`;
- have a valid 64-character hex publisher key;
- have at least one valid `sticker` tag;
- use HTTPS sticker URLs containing the advertised SHA-256.

The viewer does not evaluate HTML from relay data.

## Security And Privacy

- Nostr signatures define the pack author and update authority.
- Blossom upload auth uses the publisher's Nostr key.
- Sticker bytes are public once uploaded to Blossom.
- Signal `pack_key` material is secret import input and must not be published.
- Clients should never trust relay-provided sticker metadata without validating
  URL scheme, hash shape, MIME, dimensions, and pack format.
- Chat sticker references should include plaintext hash material so old messages
  remain stable after pack edits.

## Current Gaps

- Native app install/picker/send UI must be implemented in both `ios/` and
  `apps/sonar/` before stickers are a complete cross-platform user feature.
- The route styling should be reconciled with the Claude Design file
  `Sonar Stickers.html` when that design is available.
- The current cover tag does not encode MIME; a future version may add MIME while
  preserving backwards compatibility.
