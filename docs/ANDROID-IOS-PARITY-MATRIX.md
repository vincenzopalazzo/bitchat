# Android ↔ iOS Parity Matrix

Date: 2026-07-05. Produced by a six-agent parallel audit (messaging/delivery,
payments/wallet, calls, media/UX, iOS drift since 2026-06-27, unmerged branch
triage). iOS (`ios/bitchat/`) is the reference; Compose (`apps/sonar/`) is the
audit target. Supersedes the gap claims in
`docs/ANDROID-IOS-PARITY-DELIVERY-PLAN.md` (slices 1–4 confirmed closed by
PR #140; Slice 5 partially closed).

Classification: PARITY (equivalent), PARTIAL (present but diverges), GAP
(missing on one surface), PLATFORM-GAP (documented platform limitation, no fix
required or possible).

Line numbers are point-in-time (2026-07-05); verify before editing. Regenerate
(or amend the affected rows) on each parity PR so this stays the single source
of truth for gap status.

## Status update (2026-07-05, PR #168 second batch)

The gap rows below marked **GAP** in §2–§4 were closed on the PR #168 branch:
payment activity ledger + wallet-incoming events, offline-push cherry-picks
(#148 commits), video call enable + camera flip + voice proximity, iOS
contact-profile favorite/block/delete + blocked gating, media caption field
(both models). Still open after this batch: partial-delivery producer (mesh
tracker), Android local camera frames + remote video frames (core gap, same
as iOS), iOS Marmot transcript re-filtering on block (pre-existing),
CallKit/ConnectionService (both platforms, tracked follow-up), and all
hardware-gated device smoke.

## Verdict summary

- **iOS drift since 2026-06-27:** clean — every user-facing commit is mirrored
  or core-owned (`SonarNode.connect()` path). Account Key Durability Rule
  invariants hold on both surfaces (#158).
- **Branch triage:** `codex/android-ios-parity-slash-commands`,
  `codex/android-parity-delivery`, `codex/media-interactions-parity`,
  `claude/android-relay-thrash-parity`, `android-ios-parity` are fully merged —
  safe to delete. `codex/android-offline-push-parity` (closed PR #148) has
  unmerged value: push-prefs centralization (`SonarPushPrefs.kt`) + killed-app
  transponder wakeup detection; cherry-pick candidates `8ca9af8f`, `fe2bc048`,
  `0e4aeea1`.
- **Largest gap surface: calls** (Compose misses iOS's incoming-offer safety
  machinery and video-call UI).
- **Largest single gap: payments** — Compose has no direct wallet payment
  activity ledger (`SonarPaymentActivityLedger` equivalent).

## 5. Recommended work packages (priority order)

**WP-A — Compose call-safety pack (messaging-critical, unit-testable):**
`callIncomingOffer()` wiring, `canCall()` incoming gate, stale-offer rejection,
busy auto-decline, deferred-offer-pending-descriptor. All in
`SonarAppState.kt`; mirrors `SonarAppStore.swift:5153-5193`.

**WP-B — Messaging small fixes:** partial-delivery label in
`SonarDeliveryText.kt`; slash-command plaintext fall-through guard; folded-set
notification check; NIP-17 persistence round-trip test (+fix if broken);
bounded-window verification of core `messages_page()`.

**WP-C — Payments:** `hasLiveRate` signal; webhook marker persistence
(SharedPreferences); live balance stream (Flow); direct wallet payment
activity ledger (L — own PR); cherry-pick offline-push-parity commits.

**WP-D — Calls hardware pack (device-gated):** enable video call UI + camera
flip + local preview (CameraX); proximity wake lock.

**WP-E — iOS UX pack:** contact-profile favorite + block/delete real actions,
blocked-state unblock affordance.

**WP-F — Model hygiene (both):** optional media caption field.

Hardware-gated verification checklist stays with each WP's PR description.
