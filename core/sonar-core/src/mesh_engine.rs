//! Platform-neutral BLE mesh link state machine.
//!
//! Every platform used to re-implement the same orchestration around the mesh
//! protocol — announce/identity handling, dial policy, per-instance links,
//! liveness, Noise session lifecycle, pending sends, relay — and every bug had
//! to be found and fixed once per platform (see PR #291: zombie links, the
//! multi-service-instance lottery, write-queue races). This module owns that
//! machine once, deterministically:
//!
//! ```text
//! driver event ──▶ Engine::on_*(…, now_ms) ──▶ Output {
//!     commands: what the driver must do to the radio,
//!     events:   what the app layer must be told,
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! The engine performs no I/O and reads no clocks — `now_ms` (a MONOTONIC
//! timestamp; wall-clock would cull every link on an NTP jump) comes in with
//! every call, so every scenario is unit-testable, including process-freeze
//! recovery. Platform drivers stay thin: radio access (scan/advertise/GATT),
//! platform flow control (e.g. Android's one-outstanding-GATT-op queue and its
//! stuck-op recovery), permissions/background modes, and scheduling of the
//! `after_ms` command delays.
//!
//! Links are keyed by `(connection handle, service instance)`: one remote
//! device can expose SEVERAL instances of the mesh service behind one address
//! (a Mac running Sonar.app and the bitchat iOS-wrapper registers it twice in
//! the shared GATT database), and two apps on one controller can never hear
//! each other over the air — each instance is a distinct peer app. The handle
//! is opaque (Android: MAC address; iOS: CBPeripheral UUID — iOS never exposes
//! MAC addresses).
