//! Marmot protocol engine: MLS-over-Nostr via MDK.
//!
//! This module is the synchronous, transport-free protocol layer. It produces
//! and consumes Nostr [`Event`]s but never talks to a relay — publishing and
//! subscribing belong to [`crate::client`]. Keeping this layer pure makes it
//! testable without any network and directly bindable over FFI later.
//!
//! Protocol facts (Marmot MIPs, see CLAUDE.md):
//! - KeyPackage = kind 30443 (addressable, `d` tag), signed by the user key.
//! - Welcome   = kind 444 rumor, delivered inside a NIP-59 gift wrap (1059).
//! - Group msg = kind 445, MLS ciphertext, signed by MDK with a fresh
//!   ephemeral key per event (the user key never signs a 445).
//! - Committers must call `merge_pending_commit` only after the commit/welcome
//!   has been published; see MDK docs.
