# Assert every test cited in docs/REGRESSIONS.md exists, is a real test, and is enabled.
#
# The ledger's value is the link from an invariant to the test that pins it, and
# that link is what rots first: a test gets renamed and the entry quietly becomes
# a lie. This checks the part a machine can check.
#
# It is deliberately strict about FALSE PASSES: a checker that silently passes is
# worse than no checker. So a citation resolves only if:
#   - the declaration lives in a known test location (not production source),
#   - it is annotated as a test (@Test / #[test] / #[tokio::test]),
#   - it is not commented out and not disabled (@Ignore / #[ignore]),
#   - for Class.method, the method is inside that class's body (not merely in the
#     same file), searching every file that declares the class rather than the
#     first one found.
#
# It cannot tell whether a test is still *meaningful*, or whether it pins the real
# call site rather than a helper. Those stay review questions — see the Unguarded
# section of the ledger.
#
# Citation grammar (from "Guarded by:" / "Also guarded by:" lines):
#   `ClassName.methodName`   Kotlin / Swift test in a test source set
#   `file.rs::fn_name`       Rust #[test] / #[tokio::test] (these live in-tree
#                            under #[cfg(test)], so they are matched by file)
