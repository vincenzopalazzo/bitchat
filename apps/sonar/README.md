# Sonar — Compose Multiplatform app

One Kotlin/Compose UI codebase (`composeApp/src/commonMain`) driving Sonar on
**Android** and **Desktop** (macOS / Windows / Linux). The shared UI + app state
([`SonarAppState`](composeApp/src/commonMain/kotlin/chat/bitchat/sonar/SonarAppState.kt))
talk to a headless Rust core (`../../core`, White Noise / Marmot over Nostr) through
UniFFI/JNA bindings, plus per-platform `actual`s for radios, storage, notifications
and the wallet.

```
composeApp/src/
  commonMain/   shared UI (screens, theme, desktop shell) + SonarAppState + expect decls
  androidMain/  Android actuals (BLE mesh, Breez wallet, …) + MainActivity
  jvmMain/      Desktop actuals + Main.kt (Compose Desktop window)
  jvmTest/      Desktop FFI smoke test
```

## Platform support matrix

| Capability                          | Android | Desktop |
|-------------------------------------|:-------:|:-------:|
| White Noise (Marmot) secure DMs     |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Geohash public channels + presence  |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Encrypted media (MIP-04)            |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Profiles / verify safety numbers    |   ✅    |   ✅    |
| Location channels ("Around you")    |   ✅ GPS | ⚪️ opt-in IP geolocation (Settings) |
| BLE mesh — discovery (both ways)    |   ✅    |   ✅ scan + advertise (CoreBluetooth/BlueZ) |
| BLE mesh — messaging (DMs/broadcast)|   ✅    |   ⚪️ next stage (Noise-over-GATT transport) |
| Unify nearby payments (BLE)         |   ✅    |   ⚪️ not yet (same bridge, later) |
| Lightning wallet (⚡PAY)            |   ✅ (Breez) | ⚪️ unavailable (no desktop Breez build yet) |

Desktop covers the entire **internet-backed** surface — exactly the slice that
interops cross-platform over the same Nostr relays — plus **BLE discovery**.

- **BLE mesh** was never a hardware or Compose limitation — it's a JVM-library
  gap (no pure-JVM BLE library). The desktop drives Bluetooth through a small
  native bridge, **`core/sonar-ble`**, loaded over JNA exactly like the Rust core,
  in **both roles**:
  - **central/scan** (`btleplug` → CoreBluetooth/BlueZ) — the radar shows nearby
    bitchat-mesh phones;
  - **peripheral/advertise + GATT server** (`bluster`) — the desktop advertises
    the bitchat service and, when a phone subscribes, serves a signed **announce**
    built by the same `meshBuildAnnounce` Rust function the phones use, so the
    phone shows the desktop as a named peer.

  (`bluster` is vendored + patched — upstream advertises macOS service UUIDs as
  `NSString` instead of `CBUUID`, which CoreBluetooth rejects with "invalid
  parameters"; see `core/sonar-ble/vendor/bluster/SONAR_PATCH.md`.) Still to come:
  the **Noise-over-GATT message transport** (encrypted DMs/broadcast over the
  link) — at which point the desktop joins the mesh fully.
  - **macOS permission**: BLE needs the Bluetooth grant. The packaged `.app`
    carries `NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription` and prompts on first use. With
    `./gradlew :composeApp:run` (no `.app` bundle) macOS can't prompt, so scanning
    only returns results if the launching terminal already has the Bluetooth grant.
- **Location channels**: a desktop has no GPS, so "Around you" is empty by
  default. Enable **Settings → Approximate location** to resolve coarse
  city/region/country geohash channels from your IP (opt-in; sends your IP to a
  geolocation service). Or just join any geohash channel via Search.
- The **Lightning wallet** is a documented follow-up (a JVM Breez build, or an
  LDK/CLN/LND bridge).

## Build & run — Desktop

```bash
# 1. Build the Rust core + BLE bridge for the host (one time, or after a change).
#    Produces jvmMain/resources/<jna-prefix>/{libsonar_ffi,libsonar_ble}.<ext>
#    + the UniFFI Kotlin bindings.
core/build-desktop.sh

# 2a. Quick run (no BLE — see the permission note below).
cd apps/sonar
./gradlew :composeApp:run

# 2b. Build the installable app — REQUIRED for Bluetooth to work.
#     The .app carries NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription + the Bluetooth
#     entitlement, so macOS grants BLE. Output: build/compose/binaries/main/app/Sonar.app
./gradlew :composeApp:createDistributable          # the .app
./gradlew :composeApp:packageDistributionForCurrentOS   # a .dmg/.msi/.deb
cp -R composeApp/build/compose/binaries/main/app/Sonar.app /Applications/
open /Applications/Sonar.app
```

Desktop data (identity, encrypted Marmot DB, transcripts, prefs) lives under the
OS app-data dir, e.g. `~/Library/Application Support/Sonar` on macOS.

### Seeing mesh peers on the radar

The desktop discovers nearby bitchat-mesh phones over BLE. Two conditions:

1. **Run the packaged `.app`** (not `gradle run`) so macOS grants Bluetooth — the
   raw `java` process from `gradle run` has no `.app` bundle, so macOS can't grant
   it. On first launch, approve the Bluetooth prompt (or System Settings → Privacy
   & Security → Bluetooth → Sonar).
2. **Keep the phone's Sonar/bitchat app in the foreground** — iOS stops BLE mesh
   advertising when the app is backgrounded, so a backgrounded phone is invisible.

Then click **Sonar** in the sidebar → the phone appears as a node on the radar
(and the sidebar shows "N people in range"). Set `SONAR_BLE_DEBUG=1` to trace the
scan to `/tmp/sonar-ble.log`.

## Build & run — Android

Full guide (secrets, ABIs, release APKs, pitfalls):
[`docs/ANDROID-BUILD.md`](../../docs/ANDROID-BUILD.md).

```bash
# Gradle runs :composeApp:buildAndroidRustCore first, generating Rust .so files
# and UniFFI bindings under androidMain from core/build-android.sh.
cd apps/sonar

# Debug install (arm64-v8a only — modern phone or arm64 emulator)
./gradlew :composeApp:installDebug

# Release APK — phones only (arm64-v8a + armeabi-v7a)
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleRelease

# Universal APK — phones + x86/x86_64 emulators
./gradlew :composeApp:assembleRelease -Psonar.universalApk=true

# Optional manual core rebuild:
ANDROID_NDK_HOME=/path/to/ndk ../../core/build-android.sh
```

Put `sdk.dir` and `breez.apiKey` in gitignored `local.properties` (or export
`BREEZ_API_KEY`). Release APKs are unsigned unless you configure signing.

## Tests

```bash
./gradlew :composeApp:jvmTest   # commonTest + the desktop FFI smoke test
```

`DesktopFfiSmokeTest` proves the Rust core loads and runs through JNA on the host
(Nostr identity round-trip + a full Noise XX handshake) with no network — the key
regression guard for the desktop target.
